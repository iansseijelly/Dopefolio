            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              The diagram above is the pipeline diagram we ended up using for the final design. In the initial design,
              we have IF, D+E, and M+WB. However, we later found out the need to put the DMEM on the brink of two
              pipeline stages because it is a clocked component and doesn't support asynchronous read. So we ended up
              having to put IMEM and DMEM on the edge between two stages to save cycles and improve performance.

              A very cool part to brag about this design is the special PC register logic in the Instruction Fetching
              stage. We have designed it so that the mux chooses PC or the branch/jump target to feed into the IMEM and
              PC_D register, but the PC_reg updates its value based on either PC+4 or target+4. This way, we can
              (brilliantly) avoid any control hazards from branching or jump and thus avoid writing any logic for branch
              prediction. This design has the additional benefit of not needing to reset the PC_reg to target-4, so we
              kept the entire system intuitive and readable.

              Writing the datapath and the control logic is a relatively simple. All the components are explicitly
              drawn, and connections are out there as well. It is more of a labor than an intellectual work to just to
              code down the stream.

              However, because we firstly had no idea what is a CSR(Control Status Register) and decided to ignore it
              for now, we ran into the middle of nowhere for quite a while. Turns out the test programs utilizes the CSR
              to check for errors.

              After finishing up the CSR, it is just a matter of labor work again to fix up the rest of the code. Of
              course we make terrible coding mistakes along the way, so we must do test-oriented programming, finding
              and fixing them manually. We fixed them in the order of arithmetic operations => load word => the rest of
              load instructions => store instructions. This part of debugging only took about a weekend, so it is quite
              a breeze comparing to what's coming next.

            <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Cache</h3>
            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              Cache is where we suffered the most for sure. We were asked to design and implement a direct-mapped cache
              that is 2kB, with each cache line 512 bits. The maximum size of a DRAM available to us, though, its only
              128 bits wide (64*128), so each of the read and write operations take 4 repetitive steps to complete.

              This requires us to create a counter within the cache to keep track of what is being loaded already and
              how many more are required. In other words, the interface between the cache and the main memory is itself
              another small FSM! This is an exciting observation, and we decided to create a separate module to bring
              this obseration to life. This leads us to the mem-loader module, the bridge between cache and main memory.

              This design turns out to be fruitful in a lot of ways. Firstly, it carries out both the read and write at
              the same time, leaving the cache to be a black box to only needing to send requests by RW=1 or 0.
              Secondly, it makes the system very flexible and compatible to changes in adding additional layers of
              cache, or possibly swapping the lowest level of cache, while not confusing the main memory with changed
              requests. Lastly, this design is way easier to debug because it shows a clearer flow of signal and
              requests from the cache to the main memory.

              When cache is firstly implemented, our previous passed tests turn out to crumble down, even those R-type
              instructions that should be independent of any cache changes. Turns out the instruction cache isn't
              behaving as espected, so we connected only the icache and connected the data cache to a golden model for
              debugging purposes. This lead us to easily sort out the bug and solve it.

              However, icache processes no write requests, so it is considerably easier. Afterward, we need to solve for
              dcache and write request related bugs. Turns out the data_write_enable signal should not be impacted by
              the stalls. Fixing it fixed all the asm bugs, which means our cache works in some small programs for now.

              The benchmark test, which are larger tests specifically for testing cache accuracy and performance, took
              considerably longer to run (probably hours). We were stucked here for a long time, even taking a peek at
              the waveform became a difficult thing. Turns out the time out cycle was set to be 5*10^n, something super
              large, and we ran into an infinite loop. Fixing that, we started to debug for the write back part of the
              cache.

              Writing back is definitely the trickiest bug of the entire project. We primarily worked on a program in
              which 'Go Bears!' are capitialized into 'GO BEARS!'. This is actually quite fun because the waveform tool
              can transform series of bits into ASCII characters, and you can see all kinds of nonsenses being produced
              XD.

              Turns out the bug is, our Cache FSM is lacking a stage of reading the right thing from the cache before
              writing things back. This is why you can see things like GOAB popping around our waveforms. Fixing this,
              and some other minor bugs in other bmark tests, gave us the desired results of passing all the bmark
              tests.
